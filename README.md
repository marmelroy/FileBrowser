## Usage

Import FileBrowser at the top of the Swift file.

```swift
import FileBrowser
```

To show the file browser, all you need to do is:
```swift
let fileBrowser = FileBrowser()
present(fileBrowser, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

By default, the file browser will open in your app's documents directory. When users select a file, a preview will be displayed - offering an action sheet of options based on the file type.

## Advanced Usage

You can open FileBrowser in a different root folder by initialising with an NSURL file path of your choice.
```swift
let fileBrowser = FileBrowser(initialPath: customPath)
```

You can also allow editing/deleting files.
```swift
let fileBrowser = FileBrowser(initialPath: customPath, allowEditing: true)
```

Use the didSelectFile closure to change FileBrowser's behaviour when a file is selected.
```swift
fileBrowser.didSelectFile = { (file: FBFile) -> Void in
    print(file.displayName)
}
```

To exclude a certain file type or a specific file path:
```swift
fileBrowser.excludesFileExtensions = ["zip"]
fileBrowser.excludesFilepaths = [secretFile]
```

### Setting up with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=FileBrowser)
```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
pod 'FileBrowser', '~> 1.0'
```

### Setting up with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate FileBrowser into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "marmelroy/FileBrowser"
```
